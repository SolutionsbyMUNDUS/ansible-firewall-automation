A whitepaper on automating large-scale firewall upgrades using Ansible and custom Python libraries in a healthcare environment.

## Automating large-scale firewall upgrades with Ansible: A healthcare case study

## **Executive summary**

Staying ahead of cybersecurity threats requires timely security patches, software, and feature updates. However, managing multiple firewalls spread across diverse physical, virtual, on-premises, and cloud environments is daunting. A leading U.S. healthcare provider implemented an automated upgrade solution using Ansible and custom Python libraries to address this challenge.

**The challenge of large-scale firewall management**

Our client faced several critical challenges:

* **Scale:** Managing over 500 firewalls across multiple locations
* **Diversity:** Dealing with various firewall models and configurations
* **Operational constraints:** Maintaining 24/7 operations with minimal downtime
* **Manual inefficiency:** Time-consuming and error-prone manual upgrade processes

## **Custom automation for complex environments**

Ansible implemented its automated firewall upgrade solution using custom Python libraries, featuring:

* **HA support:** Seamless handling of various HA configurations, including active-passive, active-active, and cloud-based load balancers.
* **Platform compatibility:** Compatible across different firewall platforms, ensuring code consistency for both virtual and physical devices.
* **Automated readiness checks:** Pre-upgrade tests to confirm HA status, valid licenses, management connectivity, and disk space.
* **Snapshot and comparison tests:** Pre- and post-upgrade snapshots to detect changes impacting network stability.
* **Robust Rollback Mechanism:** This mechanism ensures the ability to quickly revert to the previous stable state if an upgrade fails.

**Key achievements**

* **500+** firewalls managed across various environments
* **24/7** operations maintained continuously with minimal disruption.
* **100**  firewall upgrades in a single maintenance window

## **From analysis to phased rollout**

Ansible followed a step-by-step plan for deploying the solution, detailing tasks, timelines, and responsible parties.

1. **Environment analysis:** Evaluation of the current infrastructure to identify requirements and potential risks before implementation.
2. **Custom module development:** Creating tailored components or scripts to meet specific business needs and integrate with existing systems.
3. **Testing and validation:** Rigorous checks to ensure the solution functions correctly and meets all performance and security standards.
4. **Phased rollout:** Gradual deployment of the solution in stages to minimize risks and allow for feedback-based adjustments.
5. **Monitoring and optimization:** Ongoing system performance tracking and making necessary adjustments to improve efficiency and reliability.

## **Achieving 100 upgrades in one maintenance window**

The automation solution enabled the healthcare provider to upgrade 100 firewalls in a single maintenance window, significantly improving efficiency and reliability. This success showcased the solution's scalability and potential for broader use in complex IT environments. 

## **Lessons from automating healthcare firewalls**

* **Modularity is key:** Flexible design for diverse environments
* **Thorough testing is crucial**: Ensures smooth operations
* **Human oversight remains important:** For handling unexpected issues
* **Scalability matters:** Design for broader application
